-f "Blight Bane|A character attuned to the staff has the ability to command blights around them of CR 2 or below using simple commands.
You can use a Bonus Action to Command how a blight moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to Attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the blight acts in a fashion appropriate to its Nature.
While you are attuned to the staff, blights and other evil plant creatures donâ€™t regard you as hostile unless you harm them."
