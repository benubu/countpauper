use initiative
!3da begin will create the deck or complain if there is no initiative
- the deck uses hp and thp to store the deck as bits, hp are the dragons except white (9x7=63 bits) thp are the white dragons(7 bits) mortals and specials (30 bits)
nb that there are 70 dragons and only 10 out of 30 special cards are chosen at the start


- ac, resist and note are still reserved, but  for what?
maxhp is what? it's set at creation but could be used after


it is added as hidden
i add 0 3da -h -p 20 -hp <lots of bits> -thp <less bits>

!3da join will join a player and subtract their (6) hand randomly from the remaining deck. Their hand is stored in their local cvar
Their initiative is set to (deck)-2* the number of players (including this one), so they are ordered by joining, but there's a spot in between each to place the deck

their hp is their hoard (maxhp is 60)
Their tho is how deep in the hole they go (6thp = -6)
their initiative is set randomly at the start. set_init can be used at the start of each round
their flight is in effects

cards are in a gvar with their key a bit value in hp or thp (thp is negative?)
name
evil=true/false or none
power=int
color=color str ?
type=dragon,legendary,mortal
power=?


sequence (coded in each player or the deck as its initiative?)
0: setup
1: ante
2: first card
2 second
3 third
4 optional tie breaker

Card code: for players hand: A B C D E F G ... shown as spoiler tags code: <name> <other properties>
!3da ante <card>  go to next sequence and add your ante as effect: Ante: card name (need to parse to and from effect description or add effect
or just !3da play <card> and it will determine that it's for the ante
or parse card description back to code Blue Dragon 9 or unique card name (look up in gvar)

Last ante will automatically resolve the bet for everyone, subtract hp for all players and add it to the pot?
The last ante will also automatically resolve the order, the deck is set as the highest (non tied) ante+1 and then the initiative is set to that player

Hand will be placed in a cvar (play?), the format is much easier to parse than the bit masks, it's just the key of the card in the database
!3da hand will show it, with a spoiler in a channel, without in a private message to avrae




Need reusable routine to extract the deck from the 3da combatant, convert it to a list, load the gvar, pick random card(s) and restore the remaining using set_hp() and set_thp()

All commands that do this may need to share code
