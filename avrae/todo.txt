!chance auto adding of save effects not done due to target/executor swap (already a one target limit)
- probably check effects during looping over targets, add boni the to target dict

Item DB: spelling and use in #count (!qb # rope)
- solution 1: synonyms list or main one
- alt should be same or less words rearranged to not require partial matching duplication

Quickbag: count plurals
Add coins to list

Remove packs
Change packs from rations to ration or keep rations in item list -.-

Remove ballbearings and other weird duplicates
