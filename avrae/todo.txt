!chance auto adding of save effects not done due to target/executor swap (already a one target limit)
- probably check effects during looping over targets, add boni the to target dict


- !play killer https://i.redd.it/fy7ksapryh141.png for PyroYoshi
    - integrate bet

Item DB: spelling and use in #count (!qb # rope)
- solution 1: synonyms list or main one
- alt should be same or less words rearranged to not require partial matching duplication
Quickbag: count release & message

Random race npc generator

* Leaf: {"field":"val"} set field
* {int:<branch>, ...} weighted randomly select branch
* [<branch>,...] randomly selecy branch
* {"key":<branch>] branch off more fields
* {"field":"@ref} reference different branch in db.
*     if key is not directly found, check weighted randoms for "samekey:value" and select that {eg: "race":{5:{"race":"Human"}} matches race.Human
*     if value is a list: check all branches with dicts again for {'samekey':'Value'}
* None: dead end/unspecified option
* argument "key=Value": select from random list
*   or from random weighted based on sub key ( think I did at least because key:list already has to handle lists, can't look for sub key
* gender
- subrace (race flexible, configurable for area)
* age
    - Make age more numeric and race specific, be able to refer to rolled values as fields like age.roll and height.value
* name
- birthplace (linked to subrace/race%)
    - Sword coast/waterdeep/faerun (can overlap area, doesnt matter), outlands, barovia, domains of dread, icewind dale
    - configurable template
    - from should be weighted table with only "plane":"prime, "continent":"fearun",
    - "from" specific over generic so from waterdeep for cities in faerun and from faerun if not specified
* Dice string detection, roll it
- update/override db with svar/uvar  TODO: what is syntax for this?
    - Should be possible to replace svar with gvar and it works
    - SHould be possible to have an svar with a gvar {default="gvar",waterdeep={my own stuff}}
- gvar references in db so {[gvar,gvar,gvar]} as an svar just works

    * relative references, otherwise gvar stuff will be weird
    * .. empty pointers remove the preceding, mostly for relative from current but could do .race..bla technically.
    * references with {field} so race.{race}.gender.{gender}, what to do if field undefined? postpone/error. right search order (should be json top down so)
    * keys that start with @ are not added to the stack (only for referal)
        * refering can be done to these without the extra @ eg { name:'@humannames', '@humannames':[foo,bar]}
- Text representation, replace fields (with bold or italic)
- weighted % is cumulative, but how mix { 1 5% 10 +5 }
# overrides: specific over generic (eye color in root is overridden by race/gender specific) due to order (breadth first? or just add new branch in front instead of end
* profession (race% and/or location %)
- physical characteristics  (% for race)
    * eye color
    - hair color (age)
    - skin color (tan, pale)
    * size
    - disabilities/tattoos/specials
- backstory generator
    - player backgrounds/professions + a tragedy + goals/ideals + bonds/religion + flaws
- remaining races heights: https://preview.redd.it/51fh9i4c9q721.png?width=1128&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3be83a5ab34fe60ca870f03161b3b3f99866cba

Structure
    - area [default in gvar]
        - races
            - gender% {"gender": percentage}
            - age range {"category":years,..}
            - physical characteristics
            - professions
            - name [references]


Quickbag: count plurals
Quickbag undo undo = redo, mention in message.
Add coins to list

Remove packs
Change packs from rations to ration or keep rations in item list -.-

Remove ballbearings and other weird duplicates

Quickbag: adding plurals can now easily end up with two separate items in bag how to fix? Remove all plurals from the table and fix plural arguments in the same way?


state: finish var rename thing
state: skill bonuses (initiative, perception especially)
state: fields from !state combat (effects, conditions, range), separate default for targeted
state: server variable for defaults ?
