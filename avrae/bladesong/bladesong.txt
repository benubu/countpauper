This adds an alias to activate or deactivate bladesong.
It can also be used for Song of Defense. It is accompanied with snippets to use when bladesong is active:
bladesong gives advantage, to use for acrobatics checks and adds intelligence bonus, to concentration saves if bladesong is activate.
victory adds Song of Victory damage to an attack.
bsadv, bsbonus and the bs alias are deprecated

The alias and snippet code is available here.
