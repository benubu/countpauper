`[<bag>] [+/-][amount] <item> [<background>] [<pack>] ...`

Add or remove multiple items to your bag or bags. Example: `!qb 2 Blanket bedroll -ration`. All item names are case insensitive and the beginning of individual words will be matched for items in Player's Handbook or in your inventory. For instance `!qb grappling` will give you a grappling hook and `!qb -rat` will remove a Ration or "Days of Rations" from the first food bag. Unless you have an actual rat in there of course, then remove that first, ew.

For items consisting of multiple words __Use "quotes"__, for instance, `!qb "Red Herring"`.

By specifying a positive number a stack of the next item will be added. Using a negative number or simply `-` the next item will be removed. Example; `!qb -5 arrow`. You can also remove a whole bag this way, e.g. `!qb -sack`. If the selected or default bag does not contain enough items, the remainder will automatically be removed from any other bag. For instance `!qb -ration` will remove a ration, even if they are not in your first bag.

Coins are automatically added to or removed from the Coin Pouch or Coinpurse, in that other. Example `!qb Blanket -5 sp`. If you don't have enough of a coin in the pouch or purse, higher value coins are exchanged. Coins placed in regular bags are only used if explicitly selected, eg `!qb Holding -1000gp`.

By specifying an owned bag, all items after it are added to that bag. `!qb Equipped dagger shortbow`. It is possible to repeat this to add multiple things to multiple bags at once, eg `!qb equip shortsword backpack 10 rations`.

If a new container is added, it will also automatically be selected for the following items. Example: `!qb Quiver 20 arrow` will add a quiver and put the arrows into it directly.

If no bag is specified, the default bag is your first bag, which is not a coin pouch or ammo container. If you don't have any bag, a free sack will be provided.

Adding a pack works differently from `!bag pack <name>`. It adds the included bag first and then all subsequent items to that container. For example `!qb priest` will add a backpack and all priest items in that backpack or into an already owned backpack.

When specifying a background, all non-optional items for that background are added to the selected bag. The starting gold is added to your pouch. Example `!qb "Folk Hero"` will give you a shovel, pot, and clothes in your default bag. 10 gp will be added to your coin pouch. You have to specify which artisan tool you selected manually for instance `!qb "Folk Hero" Herbalism`.

The recognized containers and packs can be configured in an svar/uvar/cvar `quickbag`, copy from the default `!gvar 71ff40cc-4c5f-4ae5-bdb6-32130f869090`. This also contains the exchange rate of coins.
