* Explicit wind
* Atmospheric pressure & temperature per meter, with z to meter
Explicit Atmosphere and Earth commands
Render map as one mesh with vertex color & normal and separate triangles (don't change). 
Render triangles as mesh in two passes, opaque and translucent (and not transparent)
Render density gradient with false color
Render temperature  with red channel
Wall command start(xyz) Vector(xyz) Height, width (any 50% overlapping square is stone)
Stone boundary flux = 0,0,0 (no wind)
Stone boundary density
Fix flux boundary extrapolation
Temperature <-> pressure relation (flux)
Gravity -> flux
Explosion command (xyz, force)
Lake x,y,z   z = level, fill from there, water no flux 
River xyz dxyz=speed, fill from there 
Sea level, ?   sinoid flux, variable level or pressure for tide?
