* Explicit wind
* Atmospheric pressure & temperature per meter, with z to meter
Explicit Atmosphere and Earth commands
Render density with false color
Render temperature 
Wall command start(xyz) Vector(xyz) Height, width (any 50% overlapping square is stone)
Stone boundary flux = 0,0,0 (no wind)
Stone boundary density
Fix flux boundary extrapolation
Temperature <-> pressure relation (flux)
Gravity -> flux
Explosion command (xyz, force)
Lake x,y,z   z = level, fill from there, water no flux 
River xyz dxyz=speed, fill from there 
Sea level, ?   sinoid flux, variable level or pressure for tide?
