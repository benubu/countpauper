== axiomatic predicates
= an axioma is considered true if it is contained in the knowledge
cat
cat? 
> true 
mouse?
> false

== functional predicates
= a function is true if it's label and arguments match, else it is false
cat(ginny) 
cat(ginny)?
> true
cat(gizmo)?
> false

== Clause
= a predicate is true if it is implied and it's antecedent is true
cat(ginny) : hairy(ginny)
hairy(ginny)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== Expression clause 
= an antecedent is true if it's expression evaluates to a true boolean
cat(ginny) : true
cat(ginny)?
true

== Integers 
= integers match if they are evaluate to equal
cat(ginny): legs(4)
legs(4)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== Conjunection 
= a conjunection if expressions is true if all its elements are true
cat(ginny): hairy(ginny) & noisy(ginny)
hairy(ginny)
noisy(ginny)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== DIsjunction 
A disjunction is true if at least one of its elements is true
cat(ginny): noisy(ginny) | shy(ginny)
shy(ginny)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== Summation
A summation evaluates to the sum of its elements
cat(ginny) : legs(4) 
legs(2+2)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== Variables 
= variable matching is postponed (assumptions) until the value is assigned
cat(X) : noisy(X)
noisy(ginny)
cat(ginny)?
> true 
(how it works is cat(X) matches with the query to assume X=ginny, so noise(X) is noisy(ginny), this matches)

== Equations are true if the equation is true
cat(X) : legs(X,Y), Y=4
legs(ginny, 4)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== Equations can be inequal. they are true if the value is in range
= Inequal equations 
cat(X) : legs(X,Y) Y>3
legs(ginny,4)
cat(ginny)?
> true

== Query variables 
cat(ginny)
cat(X)?
X=ginny
(how it works is cat(X) assumes X is ginny. This assumption remains)

== Sequences = ordered non-unique collection 
= you can use the @ operator to see check an array 
cat(X) : X @ [ginny,max])
cat(ginny)?
> true
(how it works, assume X=ginny, ginny @ [ginny,max] is true because ginny is in that array)

== Indexing 
= When using an integer index on an array a single element is used 
[1,2,3][2] 
> 3

== Sequence indexing
[max,ginny,gizmo][0,2]?
> [max,gizmo]

== Slicing 
= When using a range index, multiple elements are used
[1,2,3][1:2]
> [2,3]

== Infinite range 
= When not specifying a value for a range index, that side is infinite 
[1,2,3][1:]
> [2,3]

== Exclusive range 
= < > brackets are used for exclusive 
[1,2,3][1,2>
> [2]

== @ operator also works on ranges
2 @ [2:]
> true

== Clauses (functions) don't just return boolean 
= 
f(X): X+2
f(1)?
> 3

== axioms are used as variable assignment with that 
legs: 4
cat(X): legs>=3
cat(ginny)?
> true

== id axiomas are like enums 
cat: ginny 
cat ? 
> ginny 
(but it would be hard to not try to match ginny and fail and decide she's not a cat)

== Sequence/range matching 
[X,Y,Z] = [max, ginny, gizmo]
> X=max & Y=ginny & Z=gizmo 
(not sure if the assumptions should take the form of a conjunction or an array)

== Prolog like head tail matching? 
cats([H|T]) : cat(H) & cats(T)
cat(max)
cat(ginny)
cats([max,ginny])?
> true

== Also assumption assignment
.... (same knowledge as above)
cats(X)?
> X=[max,ginny]

== Queries can return expressions if assumptions aren't entirely fulfilled
f(X):X+2
f(Y)?
> X+2

== Clauses are a disjunction so multiple matches can be a disjunction
cat : 1
cat : 2
cat? 
> 1 | 2
(disjunctions of booleans are simplified to a simple computes result, predicates have to be true or at least one of them. But not cast ? why not? )

== Also element of, when the final answer is ambiguous 
cat(max)
cat(ginny)
cat(X) ? 
> X @ [max,ginny]
(this also requires to not stop matching on the first hit and keep expanding assumptions. Can be very powerful)
